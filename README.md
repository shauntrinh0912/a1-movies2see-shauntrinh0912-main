# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Movies2See

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: _Trinh Xuan Son_

This repo contains starter files:  

- `assignment1.py` is the file you must write your assignment code in.
- `movies.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
- `movies_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used in your program... This is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it again.
- `README.md` is the file you're reading. You must edit this to answer the questions below.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

> I worked on it for two weeks, it took so long because there were some small errors that were difficult to spot and fix, which took me a lot of time.

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

> I want my code to work smoothly and without making any mistakes
